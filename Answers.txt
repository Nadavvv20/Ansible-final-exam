Answers:
1. The pros are that the proccess of server configuration can
be alot easier and it gives you more flexibility to change whatever you want. 
If you want to change something specific, for example update a version of a service,
you just change a line in a playbookfile, and then run the playbook again 
instead of generating a whole new AMI image.


2. The cons are that when you launch a new server, it takes more time for it to be 
ready because you have to wait until all the configurations and services are installed
